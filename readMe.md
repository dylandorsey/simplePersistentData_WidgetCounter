#Static HTML with Persistant Data

This simple HTML file contains HTML elements and jQuery / JavaScript scripting that manipulates the DOM with a count of "widgets".

The widget count is persisted by leveraging client local storage.

##Future vision
This is the beginning of a simple ordering system for a client that uses a static HTML website.

Counts of various widgets will be updating based upon click events.

A summary of widgets and their counts will be sent to an email address by an API call to a server. The code for the email-sending server is already functional and is open-source.

The user that accesses the email will then have a purchase order / inquiry for the widgets. This will save time in communication for both the user and the user's clients.
